Installation:
    1. Download the package that contains the repository configuration and keys required to install the Proton VPN app. Enter:
        wget https://repo.protonvpn.com/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-all/protonvpn-stable-release_1.0.8_all.deb

    2. Install the Proton VPN repository containing the app. Enter:
        sudo dpkg -i ./protonvpn-stable-release_1.0.8_all.deb && sudo apt update

    Please don’t try  to check the GPG signature of this release package (dpkg-sig –verify).
    Our internal release process is split into several parts; the release package is signed with a GPG key, and the repo is signed with another GPG key.
    So the keys don’t match.
    If you want to check the repo package’s integrity, you can verify its checksum with the following command:
        echo "0b14e71586b22e498eb20926c48c7b434b751149b1f2af9902ef1cfe6b03e180 protonvpn-stable-release_1.0.8_all.deb" | sha256sum --check -

    3. Install the app. Run:
        sudo apt install proton-vpn-gnome-desktop





Notes
    1. How to remove the official Linux app
        To uninstall the Linux app, open a terminal and enter:
        sudo apt autoremove proton-vpn-gnome-desktop && sudo apt purge protonvpn-stable-release

    2. How to disable the kill switch if you have uninstalled the app You can easily turn off the kill switch inside our Linux app,
    but this isn’t possible if you’ve already uninstalled it. In this case, you can remove the kill switch and restore access to the internet as follows:

        a) Identify the Proton VPN connection name with the command:
        nmcli connection show --active
        
        This will show a list of your system’s active connections.

        b) Look for any connections that begin with prefix pvpn- 
        This usually includes pvpn-killswitch and pvpn-ipv6leak-protection, and may include pvpn-routed-killswitch.
        Delete all these connections using the following command:
        nmcli connection delete [connection name]
        For example:
        nmcli connection delete pvpn-killswitch

        c) Re-run the following command to check that all Proton VPN connections have been removed:
        nmcli connection show --active
        If you see any Proton VPN connections left, delete them as described above.
