protonvpn cli:
    Installation:
        sudo apt install proton-vpn-cli

    usag:
        protonvpn signin [username]

    connect to vpn-server:
        To connect to the fastest VPN server available on your plan, run:
        protonvpn connect

        To connect to a specific country:
        protonvpn connect --country [Country]

        For [Country], you can use country code (US, GB, DE) or its full name inside quote marks. For example:
        protonvpn connect --country US
        or
        protonvpn connect --country "United States"

        To connect to a specific city, run:
        protonvpn connect --city [City]

        For [City], simply enter a single-word city name or use quotes for multi-word names. For example:
        protonvpn connect --city miami
        or
        protonvpn connect --city "New York"

        To connect to a specific server, run:
        protonvpn connect [server name]

        You can find a list Proton VPN server names here. For example:
        protonvpn connect CH#242

        Note that country, city, state, and server names are not case sensitive, so it doesn’t matter if you use capital letters or not.


    disconnect and sign out:
        To disconnect the VPN, enter:
        protonvpn disconnect

        Note that you’ll still be signed in to your Proton VPN account. If other people use this computer, its a good idea to sign out. To do this, run:
        protonvpn signout

    configure VPN settings:
        You can configure advanced VPN settings using the protonvpn config set command. For a full list of these commands currently supported by the CLI, run:
        protonvpn config set

        In many cases, using these commands will simply toggle the feature on or off. For example:
        protonvpn config set vpn-accelerator on

        Note: These settings reset to their default when you sign out from your Proton VPN account.

    Port forwarding:
        Port forwarding routes connections through the firewall that we use to protect our customers.
        It’s mainly used for downloading and sharing files over P2P     protocols (like BitTorrent) and online gaming.

        Enable port forwarding for the Linux CLI is a two-stage process:
        1. Enable port forwarding in the CLI
            Run:
            protonvpn config set port-forwarding on
            If you’re connected to the VPN, you’ll need to reconnect for the new setting to take effect.

        2. Manually configure port forwarding
            Once the setting is enabled, you’ll need to configure port forwarding.
            To do this, visit our How to manually set up port forwarding guide, link: "https://protonvpn.com/support/port-forwarding-manual-setup#linux".
