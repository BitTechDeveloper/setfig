Downloading and Running the Script
The repository provides a single PHP script (cosmic-debian-installer.php) for installing COSMIC on Debian 13 (Trixie), supporting amd64 and arm64 architectures.

Prerequisites
Install these packages first:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libseat1 alien php-cli php-xml sudo


Steps

1. Download the script
Use one of these methods:

Clone the repository:
    git clone https://codeberg.org/ashimokawa/cosmic-debian-installer.git
    cd cosmic-debian-installer
__OR__
download the script directly:
    wget https://codeberg.org/ashimokawa/cosmic-debian-installer/raw/branch/main/cosmic-debian-installer.php
    chmod +x cosmic-debian-installer.php


2. Run the script
    php cosmic-debian-installer.php
__OR__
(Or ./cosmic-debian-installer.php if made executable.)

The script fetches the latest COSMIC RPMs from Fedora COPR.
It downloads them to a cache/ directory (skipping existing ones).
It converts them to .deb using alien.
It installs with sudo (password prompt possible).
Expect long runtime due to many packages and conversion.


3. Log in to COSMIC (with GDM):
Log out, select your user, choose "COSMIC" session, and log in.

Warnings: This is a workaround ("hack") using RPM-to-DEB conversion. Installation takes significant time. Uninstall by removing the converted .deb packages if needed. Last repository update: January 6, 2026.
